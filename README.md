## Business Intelligence Project: Obesity classification for nutrition programs creation

#### Introduction
This README file provides an overview of a Business Intelligence (BI) project plan focused on the classification of obesity levels in individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. The dataset used for this project consists of 17 attributes and 2111 records, with labels assigned to the class variable NObesity, enabling the classification into categories such as Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, and Obesity Type III.

#### Dataset Information
- Multivariate: dataset involves observations or samples with more than one variable or feature.
- Subject Area: health and medicine.
- Feature Type: integer.

#### Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this BI project are as follows:

- Obesity Classification: Establish obesity levels based on individuals eating habits and physical condition.
- Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.
- Visualization: Implement a visualization tool to present the insights.

#### Data Source and Composition
The dataset is a combination of synthetic data generated using the Weka tool and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) filter (77%), along with direct data collected from users through a web platform (23%).

#### Planning of the project
** DAY 1
1. Acquire the dataset.
2. Download the dataset from the source.
3. Verify the dataset format and structure.
4. Load the dataset into a data frame (e.g., pandas DataFrame in Python).

** DAY 2
1. Data wrangling.
2. Display basic information (e.g., number of rows, columns, data types).
3. Decide on a strategy for handling missing data (e.g., imputation or removal). Implement the chosen strategy.
4. Stating hypothesis.

** DAY 3
1. Plot histograms for numerical variables to understand their distributions.
2. Create bar charts for categorical variables.
3. Working on visaulizations and getting insights.


** DAY 4 
1. Make conclusions.
2. Work on the presentation.
3. Prepare for presentation.
